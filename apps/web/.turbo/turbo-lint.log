(node:37311) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/evaldomacielfilho/Downloads/crm%20JurisNexo/jurisnexo/packages/@jurisnexo/config/dist/env.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
